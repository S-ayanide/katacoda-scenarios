LitmusChaos is a Cloud-Native Chaos Engineering Framework with cross-cloud support. It is a CNCF Sandbox project with adoption across several organizations. Its mission is to help Kubernetes SREs and Developers to find weaknesses in both Non-Kubernetes as well as platforms and applications running on Kubernetes by providing a complete Chaos Engineering framework and associated Chaos Experiments.

Litmus can be used to run chaos experiments initially in the staging environment and eventually in production to find bugs and vulnerabilities, fixing which leads to an increased resilience of the system. Litmus adopts a `Kubernetes-native` approach to define chaos intent in a declarative manner via custom resources.

## **In this scenario you will learn how to:**

- Deploy Litmus 2.0 into a Kubernetes Cluster.
  - Via kubectl
  - Via Helm
- Access the ChaosCenter post installation

<br>

## ChaosCenter

The ChaosCenter is a single source of truth to control all the different Chaos Activities happening around Litmus and it comes pre-packaged with the installation. From the ChaosCenter you get the freedom to manage every single part of Litmus and shape your workflows exactly the way you want it.

## Advantages of Litmus 2.0

Over time, with the monthly cadence releases and community engagement, we have added a lot of features and made LitmusChaos much easier for the end-users. With the launch of Litmus 2.0, a new way of chaos engineering can be performed by the users, a few high-level features are mentioned [here](https://litmusdocs-beta.netlify.app/docs/next/introduction/features)
